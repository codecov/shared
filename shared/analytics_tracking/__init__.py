    Track a specific event and accompanying data.

    - The ownerid of the organization associated with this event,
    when applicable. (May be the same as ownerid of logged-in user,
    if event relates to resources on their personal account rather than
    a team or organization)
    Examples: plan changed, repo activated, coverage report uploaded.

    - The ownerid of the logged-in user, when the event isn't specific
    to a particular organization or resource. 
    Examples: sign in, sign out.
