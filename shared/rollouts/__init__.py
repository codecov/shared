class Feature:
    """
    Represents a feature and its rollout parameters, fetched from the database (see django_apps/rollouts/models.py).
    Given an identifier (repo_id, owner_id, etc..), it will decide which variant of a feature should be
    used for the request. Each variant will have a `value` that will be returned if that variant is decided to
    be used. For example: if you want an ON and OFF variant for your feature, you could have the values
    be true and false respectively

    You can modify the parameters of your feature flag via Django Admin. The parameters are fetched and updated roughly
    every 5 minutes, meaning it can take up to 5 minutes for changes to show up here.

    If you manage your own deployment, you can disable or override feature checks with environment variables:
    - If `CODECOV__FEATURE__{name.upper()}` is set, its value will be deserialized as JSON and returned for the
      `Feature` with that name
    - If `CODECOV__FEATURE__DISABLE` is set, checks will be skipped and default values will be returned every time
      for every feature except those with overrides set via `CODECOV__FEATURE__{name.upper()}` env vars

    If you instantiate a `Feature` instance with a new name, the associated database entry
    will be created for you. Otherwise, the existing database entry will be used to populate
    the values. Also if you change the name of an existing feature, you will need to update
    the name where it is instrumented in the code aswell.

    Examples:

    A simple on/off feature rolled out to 20% of repos:
        # By default, features have no variants â€” you create them via Django Admin. You can create the `on`
        # variant there, along with setting the proportion and salt for the flag.
        MY_FEATURE_BY_REPO = Feature("my_feature")

        # DB:
        # FeatureFlag:
        #   name: my_feature
        #   proportion: 0.0 # default value
        #   salt: ajsdopijaejapvjghiujnarapsjf # default is randomly generated
        #
        # FeatureFlagVariant:
        #   name: my_feature_on
        #   feature_flag: my_feature
        #   proportion: 1
        #   value: true

    A simple A/B test rolled out to 10% of users (5% test, 5% control):
        MY_EXPERIMENT_BY_USER = Feature("my_experiment")

        # DB:
        # FeatureFlag:
        #   name: my_experiment
        #   proportion: 0.1
        #   salt: foajdisjfosdjrandomfsfsdfsfsfs
        #
        # FeatureFlagVariant:
        #   name: test
        #   feature_flag: my_experiment
        #   proportion: 0.5
        #   value: true
        #
        # FeatureFlagVariant:
        #   name: control
        #   feature_flag: my_experiment
        #   proportion: 0.5
        #   value: false

    After creating a feature, you can instrument it in code like so:
        from shared.rollouts.features import MY_EXPERIMENT_BY_USER
        if MY_EXPERIMENT_BY_USER.check_value(user_id, default=False) == True:
            new_behavior()
        else:
            old_behavior()

    Parameters:
    - `name`: the unique name of your feature flag you created in django admin

    If you discover a bug and roll back your feature, it's good practice to
    change the salt to any other string before restarting the rollout. Changing
    the salt basically reassigns every id to a new bucket so the same users
    don't feel churned by our rocky rollout.
