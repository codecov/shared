class Feature:
    """
    Represents a feature and its rollout parameters, fetched from the database (see django_apps/rollouts/models.py).
    Given an identifier (repo_id, owner_id, etc..), it can decide which variant of a feature (if any)
    should be enabled for the request. The parameters are fetched and updated roughly every
    5 minutes, meaning it can take up to 5 minutes for changes to show up here. You can modify
    the values via Django Admin.

    If you instantiate a `Feature` instance with a new name, the associated database entry
    will be created for you. Otherwise, the existing database entry will be used to populate
    the values. Also if you change the name of an existing feature, you will need to update
    the name where it is instrumented in the code aswell.

    Examples:

    A simple on/off feature rolled out to 20% of repos:
        # By default, features have no variants â€” you create them via Django Admin. You also create the `on` variant there.
        MY_FEATURE_BY_REPO = Feature("my_feature", 0.2)

        # DB:
        # FeatureFlagVariant:
        #   name: my_feature_on
        #   feature_flag: my_feature
        #   proportion: 1
        #   enabled: True

    A simple A/B test rolled out to 10% of users (5% test, 5% control):
        MY_EXPERIMENT_BY_USER = Feature(
            "my_experiment",
            0.1,
        )

        # DB:
        # FeatureFlagVariant:
        #   name: MY_EXPERIMENT_BY_USER_TEST
        #   feature_flag: MY_EXPERIMENT_BY_USER
        #   proportion: 0.5
        #   enabled: True
        #
        # FeatureFlagVariant:
        #   name: MY_EXPERIMENT_BY_USER_CONTROL
        #   feature_flag: MY_EXPERIMENT_BY_USER
        #   proportion: 0.5
        #   enabled: False

    After creating a feature, you can instrument it in code like so:
        from shared.rollouts.features import MY_EXPERIMENT_BY_USER
        if MY_EXPERIMENT_BY_USER.is_enabled(user_id, default=False):
            new_behavior()
        else:
            old_behavior()

    Parameters:
    - `name`: a unique name for the experiment.
    - `proportion`: a float between 0 and 1 representing how much of the
      population should get a variant of the feature. 0.5 means 50%.
    - `salt`: a way to effectively re-shuffle which bucket each id falls into

    If you discover a bug and roll back your feature, it's good practice to
    change the salt to any other string before restarting the rollout. Changing
    the salt basically reassigns every id to a new bucket so the same users
    don't feel churned by our rocky rollout.
