/*
These are the SQL queries used in Metabase so that we can make the feature flag experiment dashboards like this:
https://metabase.codecov.dev/question/170-experiment-dashboard-by-owner-id?variant_name=list_repos_generator&metric=worker.task.app.tasks.sync_repos.SyncRepos.core_runtime&start_date=2024-04-30

These SQL queries are used for the following two dashboards:
https://metabase.codecov.dev/question/175-experiment-dashboard-by-repo-id?variant_name=&metric=&start_date=
https://metabase.codecov.dev/question/170-experiment-dashboard-by-owner-id?variant_name=&metric=&start_date=

The relevant tables are: `feature_exposures`, `telemetry_simple`, `feature_flags`, and `feature_flag_variants`. We bucket the timestamps based on the hour which is how we're able to correlate
feature exposures with the telemetry simple metrics. 

The {{___}} notation with {{variant_name}} or {{metric}} are a metabase specific thing that allow us to have variable dropdowns in the dashboard, which is configured through the Metabase UI. Note:
the values populated for {{metric}} are actually hardcoded because querying for all the metrics on-demand was too long of a query. If new metrics/celery tasks are added, those values need to be 
populated via the Metabase UI.
